[Adobe Open Source](http://adobe.github.com)
=======================

Presenting [Adobe Github Homepage v2.0](http://adobe.github.com), the new central hub for **Adobe Open sources** projects.

Allowing you to **search through Adobe Github repositories**, you can focus on what you are passionated about.

- You are a *web developer*? Search the repositories only containing *Javascript* code, because it rocks!
- You love doing *technology watching*? Order by *Popularity*, by *Last Push* or select only the *5 stars (>1k followers)* projects to get the hotest repos!
- You are a *web designer* and want the perfect code editor? Search *brackets* and get all the repositories related to this awesome project!
- You are a *researcher*? Check out the project pushed in Open Source by *Adobe Research*!

As you can see, we love Open Source. That's why we built this project on top of cutting-edge technologies like:

- [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/),
- [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/),
- [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) and [API](http://developer.github.com/v3/),
- [NodeJS](nodejs.org)
- [D3](http://d3js.org/)
- and many more!

The [Adobe Creative Cloud](http://www.adobe.com/products/creativecloud.html) was also a great asset for [designing](photoshop.com) and [coding](brackets.io) purposes.

## Architecture

Hummm... you want to learn more about how all this is structured? A good sketch is better than a long speech, so here is a little schema:

<p align="center"> <img src="https://raw2.github.com/adobe/adobe.github.com/master/img/schema_adobe_open_source.png"  alt="Adobe Open Source schema" /></p>

The information is pulled directly from the Github API and aggregated by a NodeJS server (its code source is available [in this repository](https://github.com/kimchouard/server.adobe.github.com)). It is made available through an simple REST API, thanks to restify.

AngularJS then make a unique API call to the server and inject the data on your browser, based on dc.js and the Fondation CSS framework. The filtering engine for the repositories was built on top of Angular.
